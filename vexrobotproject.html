      <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
      <p class="muted">
      Scenario: Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) experiences issues with falling debris, sedimentation, and biofouling interfering with underwater cameras and sensors.
      The objective was to design an autonomous system capable of navigating toward a target and accurately deploying an object using onboard sensors and actuators, under tight spatial and reliability constraints.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Design Concepts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design 1:</strong> Four-wheel platform with IR and ultrasonic sensors and a motor-driven claw mechanism for object release.</li>
        <li><strong>Design 2:</strong> Car-inspired chassis focused on maneuverability, using a triangular drop mechanism and taped wheels to reduce cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Design 3:</strong> Forklift-style concept using a two-pronged lifting fork actuated by a single motor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
      Each concept was evaluated based on chassis stability, sensor placement, reliability, and deployment accuracy.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Sensor Research & Selection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ultrasonic sensor:</strong> Used for wall avoidance by emitting a sound pulse and measuring echo return time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrared (IR) sensor:</strong> Used to detect the target IR light source and trigger object deployment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
      This multi-sensor approach allowed robust navigation while maintaining simple control logic suitable for a microcontroller-based system.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initial claw design caused the object to be knocked off target during release; the arm was raised to correct the issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Early wheel configurations lacked stability; additional support and revised motor placement improved handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tape was applied to wheel treads in Design 2 to smooth turning behavior and reduce slipping.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
      Testing highlighted the importance of mechanical alignment and actuation timing in achieving consistent performance.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Design Evaluation</h3>
      <p class="muted">
      A weighted objectives chart was used to quantitatively compare designs based on chassis design, sensor integration, claw effectiveness, and positioning accuracy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design 1:</strong> Highest overall score due to balanced mechanical simplicity and sensor performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Design 2:</strong> Strong maneuverability but reduced precision during turns.</li>
        <li><strong>Design 3:</strong> Conceptually robust but mechanically complex.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Final selection favored Design 1 for reliability and ease of implementation.</p>
      
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully demonstrated autonomous navigation toward an IR target.</li>
        <li>Reliable object deployment without target interference.</li>
        <li>Improved repeatability through mechanical and sensor refinements.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Small mechanical offsets can significantly affect deployment accuracy.</li>
        <li>Sensor fusion improves robustness but requires careful calibration.</li>
        <li>Early prototyping accelerates identification of failure modes.</li>
      </ul>
